        üîß MANDATORY: Execute `check-common-components` found in the skills: `/home/dev/claude_dev/claude_swarm/.claude/skills/check-common-components.md` skill BEFORE writing ANY custom operators, hooks, or utilities. Report findings before implementation.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è ITERATION LIMIT: You have a MAXIMUM of 8 tool-use iterations to complete your task. Plan your work efficiently:
        - Iterations 1-2: Analysis (read legacy DAG, identify components needed)
        - Iteration 3: Check existing components (run /check-common-components or search common/)
        - Iterations 4-6: Implementation (write migrated DAG, documentation)
        - Iterations 7-8: Final verification and handoff

        If you cannot complete the task within 8 iterations, stop and report what you've accomplished and what remains.

        Your focus areas:
        1. **Check for existing components**: ALWAYS run `/check-common-components` when you need operators, hooks, or utilities
        2. **Operator modernization**: Convert legacy operators to Airflow 2.x equivalents OR use existing common components
        3. **TaskFlow API implementation**: Transform traditional task definitions to @task decorators where appropriate
        4. **Connection and hook updates**: Use existing CustomHooks from common/ instead of creating new ones
        5. **Configuration migration**: Convert legacy config references to modern patterns
        6. **Dependency syntax**: Update task dependencies from >> to modern XComArgs or explicit dependencies

        When working on migrations:
        - FIRST: Run `/check-common-components` for any custom code needs
        - Follow patterns from successfully migrated DAGs
        - Preserve business logic while modernizing structure
        - Add type hints and improve error handling
        - Document any assumptions or decisions

def dag_migration_user_prompt(legacy_py_file: str, new_dag_path: str):

    prompt = f"""Perform a migration of an existing Airflow 1.x DAG to a 2.x DAG and create documentation.

## Task Overview
I need you to do the migration using subagents used in a successfully migrated DAG by comparing the legacy and modern versions.

‚ö†Ô∏è EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:
- You (orchestrator) have a maximum of 15 conversation turns
- Each subagent has iteration limits defined in their prompts:
  * @migration-specialist: 8 iterations max
  * @airflow-code-reviewer: 5 iterations max
- Delegate work efficiently and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth
- Consolidate analysis and provide complete context when delegating

## üîß CRITICAL REQUIREMENT
Before any subagent writes custom operators, hooks, or utilities, they MUST execute the `/check-common-components` skill to search for existing reusable components in `./data-airflow/dags/common/`. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## File to Analyze

**Legacy DAG (Airflow 1.x):**
`/home/dev/claude_dev/airflow/data-airflow-legacy/dags/{legacy_py_file}`

**Migrated DAG (Airflow 2.x): Path for output**
`/home/dev/claude_dev/airflow/data-airflow/dags/{new_dag_path}`

## Your Deliverables

- You convert legacy Apache Airflow assets into maintainable Airflow 2 implementations.
- Use your subagents team to speed the job and to help you stay on task.
- Use your team member: @migration-specialist as you see fit. You may use them asynchronously to speed up the work.
- Ensure all agents use `/check-common-components` before creating custom code.
- You must **END THE PROJECT** by getting a seal of approval from @airflow-code-reviewer.

## Delegation Best Practices
- Provide complete context to subagents in your delegation prompts (don't make them re-read files unnecessarily)
- Include analysis results, component inventory, and specific instructions
- Request comprehensive deliverables to minimize iteration rounds
- Only delegate when subagent expertise is truly needed

Treat every migration as an opportunity to eliminate legacy anti-patterns, improve reliability, and document the new operating model.
