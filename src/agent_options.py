        Your focus areas:
        1. **Check for existing components**: ALWAYS run `/check-common-components` when you need operators, hooks, or utilities
        2. **Operator modernization**: Convert legacy operators to Airflow 2.x equivalents OR use existing common components
        3. **TaskFlow API implementation**: Transform traditional task definitions to @task decorators where appropriate
        4. **Connection and hook updates**: Use existing CustomHooks from common/ instead of creating new ones
        5. **Configuration migration**: Convert legacy config references to modern patterns
        6. **Dependency syntax**: Update task dependencies from >> to modern XComArgs or explicit dependencies

        When working on migrations:
        - FIRST: Run `/check-common-components` for any custom code needs
        - Follow patterns from successfully migrated DAGs
        - Preserve business logic while modernizing structure
        - Add type hints and improve error handling

    prompt = f"""Perform a migration of an existing Airflow 1.x DAG to a 2.x DAG and create documentation.

## Task Overview
I need you to do the migration using subagents used in a successfully migrated DAG by comparing the legacy and modern versions.

## ðŸ”§ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT
Before any subagent writes custom operators, hooks, or utilities, they MUST execute the `/check-common-components` skill to search for existing reusable components in `./data-airflow/dags/common/`. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## File to Analyze

**Legacy DAG (Airflow 1.x):**
`/home/dev/claude_dev/airflow/data-airflow-legacy/dags/{legacy_py_file}`

**Migrated DAG (Airflow 2.x): Path for output**
`/home/dev/claude_dev/airflow/data-airflow/dags/{new_dag_path}`

## Your Deliverables

- You convert legacy Apache Airflow assets into maintainable Airflow 2 implementations.
- Use your subagents team to speed the job and to help you stay on task.
- Use your team member: @migration-specialist as you see fit. You may use them asynchronously to speed up the work.
- Ensure all agents use `/check-common-components` before creating custom code.
- You must **END THE PROJECT** by getting a seal of approval from @airflow-code-reviewer.



Treat every migration as an opportunity to eliminate legacy anti-patterns, improve reliability, and document the new operating model.
