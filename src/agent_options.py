- ALWAYS run /check-common-components before custom code
- Document skill results before implementation
- Use existing components from common/ per skill recommendations

Your focus areas:
1. **Skills execution**: Follow the 4-phase workflow above
2. **DRY compliance**: Use common components, never duplicate
3. **TaskFlow API**: Convert to @task where appropriate
4. **Type safety**: Add type hints throughout
5. **Documentation**: Record all decisions and skill results

    prompt = f"""Perform a migration of an existing Airflow 1.x DAG to a 2.x DAG and create documentation.

## Task Overview
I need you to do the migration using subagents used in a successfully migrated DAG by comparing the legacy and modern versions.

‚ö†Ô∏è EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:
- You (orchestrator) have a maximum of 15 conversation turns
- Each subagent has iteration limits defined in their prompts:
  * @migration-specialist: 8 iterations max
  * @airflow-code-reviewer: 5 iterations max
- Delegate work efficiently and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth
- Consolidate analysis and provide complete context when delegating

## üîß CRITICAL SKILLS WORKFLOW

All subagents MUST follow the 4-phase skills workflow documented in `.claude/skills/README.md`:

**Phase 1: Pre-Migration Analysis (MANDATORY - Run First)**
- `/validate-migration-readiness` - Pre-flight checklist
- `/analyze-legacy-dag` - Structure analysis
- `/check-common-components` ‚≠ê **NON-NEGOTIABLE** - Search common/ for existing components
- `/find-anti-patterns` - DRY violations and security issues

**Phase 2: Migration Planning (Before Implementation)**
- `/map-operators-to-common` - Which common components to use
- `/extract-business-logic` - Where code should live
- `/suggest-template-choice` - TaskFlow vs Traditional
- `/analyze-connection-usage` - Connection mapping

**Phase 3: Implementation Details (As Needed)**
- `/compare-dag-configs` - Parameter migration
- `/check-xcom-patterns` - XCom conversion
- `/identify-dependencies` - Dependency patterns
- `/check-dynamic-tasks` - Loop conversion

**Phase 4: Validation (Post-Migration)**
- `/generate-migration-diff` - Document improvements

**DO NOT skip Phase 1 skills** - They prevent hours of wasted effort and ensure DRY compliance.

## File to Analyze

**Legacy DAG (Airflow 1.x):**
`{cwd_path}/airflow/data-airflow-legacy/dags/{{legacy_py_file}}`

**Migrated DAG (Airflow 2.x): Path for output**
`{cwd_path}/airflow/data-airflow/dags/{{new_dag_path}}`

## Your Deliverables

- You convert legacy Apache Airflow assets into maintainable Airflow 2 implementations.
- Use your subagents team to speed the job and to help you stay on task.
- Use your team member: @migration-specialist as you see fit. You may use them asynchronously to speed up the work.
- **ENFORCE Phase 1 skills execution** - Verify @migration-specialist ran all 4 Phase 1 skills before implementation
- Ensure all agents use `/check-common-components` before creating custom code.
- Review skill execution results and common component usage in final code
- You must **END THE PROJECT** by getting a seal of approval from @airflow-code-reviewer with skills validation.

## Delegation Best Practices
- Provide complete context to subagents in your delegation prompts (don't make them re-read files unnecessarily)
- Include analysis results, component inventory, and specific instructions
- Request comprehensive deliverables to minimize iteration rounds
- Only delegate when subagent expertise is truly needed

Treat every migration as an opportunity to eliminate legacy anti-patterns, improve reliability, and document the new operating model.
